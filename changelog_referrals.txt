Changelog â€” Referral Levels + Commission Tracking (Demo)
====================================================

Files updated:
- nav-active.js
  * Capture ?ref and optional ?u2 parameters (first-touch).
  * Save tmRefBy and tmRefBy2 (if provided).
  * Increase inviter's L1 count: localStorage key 'countL1_<refCode>'.

- site.js
  * Added COMM rates: L1 = 10%, L2 = 5% (demo) at the top.

- script.js
  * Added tm_awardCommission(amount) to allocate commissions to uplines.
  * On deposit confirmation, commissions are credited to:
      'comm_<L1code>' += amount * COMM.L1
      'comm_<L2code>' += amount * COMM.L2 (only if tmRefBy2 exists)
    Also increments 'countL2_<L2code>'.
  * Added tm_recordDeposit(amount) for future hooks.

- team.html
  * Displays earned commissions from 'comm_<myInviteCode>'.
  * L1/L2 counts pulled from 'countL1_<myInviteCode>' and 'countL2_<myInviteCode>'.
  * Total team = L1 + L2.
  * Invite link now appends '&u2=<your upline>' automatically if you have an upline (tmRefBy).

Notes:
- This is a localStorage-based demo simulation of a global referral tree.
- To attribute deposits to an inviter in the same browser, the *referred user* must land with '?ref=<INVITER_CODE>' (and optionally '&u2=<L2_CODE>') before making a deposit.
